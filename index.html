        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="quote">Aspired to create beautiful things â™¥</p>
        <p>Here are just a few small facts about myself: 
          After my second year at BSTU I went to China for a year on a government scholarship not knowing anyone or anything there. Started learning Chinese and met a lot of wonderful people there. 
          When came back, finished university, and in-beetwen my main job started self-studying Python for a few months but decided to move to JS as I find front-end more fascinating.
